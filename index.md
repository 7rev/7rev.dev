7rev started as two software engineers with a strong interest in fintech and in particular cryptocurrencies. 7rev was founded with a focus on proof of stake and decentralized finance. We are not yet another staking platform or yet another decentralized finance platform. We want to fill the gap between the user and several decentralized finance tools that spring up like mushrooms. We will actively be developing open-source tools that will support people in tracking their staking rewards. Also we are interested in developing trading bots with different strategies (market making, arbitrage et cetera). 

We will also be developing tools for cryptocurrency accounting. We want to be able to track different blockchains and price history. To support our daily operations, as well as to be actively engaged in the community, we will also run nodes in distributed ledger networks.
